### Summary of the Plan:
- **Total Estimated Days**: 10
- **Phases**: Planning, Development, Testing, Documentation
- **Key Tasks**: Clarifying scope, designing data models, building the backend and frontend, handling file uploads, integrating external services, testing, and documentation.

This plan provides a clear roadmap for developing the meeting recording summary tool, ensuring all aspects are covered from planning to documentation.
