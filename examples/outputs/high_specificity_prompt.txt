```

### Summary of the Plan:
- **Phases**: The project is divided into four main phases: Planning, Development, Testing, and Deployment.
- **Complexity**: The project is estimated to be of large complexity, with an estimated duration of approximately 5.7 to 8.6 days.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear criteria are defined to ensure the functionality meets user expectations and handles edge cases effectively. 

This structured plan will guide the development team through the implementation of the Meeting Summarization Tool.
