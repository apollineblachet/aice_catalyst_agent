Here's a structured development plan for the web-based feature that automatically summarizes recorded team meetings:

### Development Plan

#### Complexity Estimate
- **Feature Name**: Meeting Summarization Tool
- **Complexity**: Large
- **Estimated Days**: 5.2 to 7.7 days
- **Notable Risks**:
  - External API instability or rate limits
  - Data migration or schema mismatch
  - Concurrency/hotspot contention
  - Large file handling/storage costs
  - Ambiguities/assumptions

#### Phases and Tasks

1. **Phase 1: Planning and Design**
   - **Task 1**: Clarify scope & constraints
     - **Description**: Confirm must-haves, non-goals, and edge cases; note unknowns & risks.
   - **Task 2**: Data model / schema sketch
     - **Description**: Identify entities, fields, and minimal schema changes needed.
   - **Task 3**: Backend API surface
     - **Description**: Define endpoints, request/response contracts, and validation rules.
   - **Task 4**: Frontend UI skeleton
     - **Description**: Create minimal UI flow and states (loading, success, error).

2. **Phase 2: Implementation**
   - **Task 5**: Implement file upload feature
     - **Description**: Create a UI form for users to upload audio/video files.
   - **Task 6**: Integrate transcription API
     - **Description**: Connect to OpenAI Whisper or AssemblyAI for transcribing uploaded files.
   - **Task 7**: Generate summaries from transcripts
     - **Description**: Develop logic to summarize transcripts highlighting key decisions and action items.
   - **Task 8**: Create dashboard for viewing transcripts and summaries
     - **Description**: Build a dashboard to display the transcript and summary to users.
   - **Task 9**: Implement download functionality
     - **Description**: Allow users to download transcripts and summaries as text or PDF.

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Validation**
   - **Task 10**: Functional tests (happy paths)
     - **Description**: Automate the main success scenarios end-to-end or via API.
   - **Task 11**: Error & edge-case tests
     - **Description**: Cover invalid inputs, timeouts, and permission errors.
   - **Task 12**: Docs & handoff
     - **Description**: Write a concise README with setup, env vars, run & test commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- **Task 1**: Implement file upload feature
  - Given a user is on the relevant screen or context, when they implement file upload feature with valid inputs, then the UI reflects the change with a success indicator.
  - Given a user attempts to implement file upload feature, when the input is missing required field or invalid format, then an accessible inline error is displayed and no changes are saved.

- **Task 2**: Integrate transcription API
  - Given a user is on the relevant screen or context, when they integrate transcription API with valid inputs, then the API responds with 2xx and a correct payload.
  - Given a user attempts to integrate transcription API, when the input is missing required field or invalid format, then the operation is rejected with a clear error and nothing is persisted.

- **Task 3**: Generate summaries from transcripts
  - Given a user is on the relevant screen or context, when they generate summaries from transcripts with valid inputs, then the expected result is shown.
  - Given a user attempts to generate summaries from transcripts, when the input is missing required field or invalid format, then the operation is rejected with a clear error and nothing is persisted.

- **Task 4**: Create dashboard for viewing transcripts and summaries
  - Given a user is on the relevant screen or context, when they create dashboard for viewing transcripts and summaries with valid inputs, then the UI reflects the change with a success indicator.
  - Given a user attempts to create dashboard for viewing transcripts and summaries, when the input is missing required field or invalid format, then an accessible inline error is displayed and no changes are saved.

- **Task 5**: Implement download functionality
  - Given a user is on the relevant screen or context, when they implement download functionality with valid inputs, then the expected result is shown.
  - Given a user attempts to implement download functionality, when the input is missing required field or invalid format, then the operation is rejected with a clear error and nothing is persisted.
