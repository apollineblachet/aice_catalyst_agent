We want something that can take a meeting recording and give us a short summary of what was discussed.
It should somehow transcribe the conversation and highlight important points or next steps.

Ideally, it’s easy to use — maybe a simple page where we can upload the file and get the summary.
The details are flexible — use whatever tech makes sense, as long as the summary is clear and useful for team follow-ups.
