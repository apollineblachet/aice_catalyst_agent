We need a tool that can take recorded meetings and turn them into short, readable summaries.
Users should be able to upload audio or video files, get a transcription, and view or download both the transcript and summary.

The backend should likely use Python, and the frontend should be web-based (React or another simple framework). Transcription can use an external service like Whisper.

It should be fast enough for team use and produce reliable summaries. The interface should be easy to use, and the results should be available for download.

Goal: Users should quickly understand key points and decisions from their meetings without reading the entire transcript.
